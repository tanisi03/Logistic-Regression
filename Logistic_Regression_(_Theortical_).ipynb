        "\n",
        "• Softmax Regression (or Multinomial Logistic Regression) is an extension of logistic regression for multiclass classification (more than two classes). It uses the softmax function to compute probabilities for multiple classes, and the class with the highest probability is chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, Logistic Regression is for binary classification, and Softmax Regression is for multiclass classification."
